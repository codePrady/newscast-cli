# Features to add

## Upcoming features

- Show subheadings for each of the headings - this gives more context when the heading is too short
- Paragraph spacing for better readability - Now all 'p' tags are thrown to user as one single text dump. - Need spacing for easier reading.
- Add more sources for Science category alone - But don't add too many as this is meant to have only favorites
- Add some colors - Use Chalk package to improve colors
- Estimate reading time - Like Medium does. That would be fun
- Give URL links at the beginning or end - Will help if I have to cmd+click to open in browser (but do you need that?)
- A lot more refactoring needed in code - Checkout best practices
- Build a UI for this instead as a separate project - Use my React knowledge to build this
